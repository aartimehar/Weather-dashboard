## Usage 

A weather application can be used to check the current weather conditions, as well as the forecast for future days, for a specified location. The application can provide information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, chance of precipitation, and the overall weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.). This information can be used to plan outdoor activities, prepare for potential weather-related events, or simply stay informed about current weather conditions.
